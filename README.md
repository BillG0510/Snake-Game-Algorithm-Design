# Snake-Game-Algorithm-Design
- Built functions to let the snake move in a 32*32 square (the path the snake pass will become its body)
- Let the snake have two chances to break its or others’ body
- Used different algorithms to design the snakes’ routes (longer the better, will die if it is blocked)
- Implemented different method: walking to directions that have more space, take the closer paths, block others
- Put 1- 4 snakes in a square and test who will win
